### Chapter 3: The Charioteer’s Warning

As we walked, I couldn't keep my eyes off Ashley. Gathering my courage, I finally asked, "So, how were you?"

She smiled warmly. "I missed you. And I see you printed out my photo," she said, making me blush even harder.

I quickly changed the subject, asking, "How are we getting to camp?"

Instead of answering, Ashley turned to an empty parking spot, dropped a golden drachma, and said, "Oh Aruna, charioteer of the gods, take my offering." A bright light flashed, and suddenly a taxi appeared. It looked almost transparent, and in the driver's seat sat Aruna, the charioteer of the sun god.

"Where to?" Aruna asked.

"Camp Half-Blood," Ashley replied.

We both climbed into the passenger seat, and the god-taxi picked up speed like nothing I had ever experienced before. It was so fast that I hoped it would end soon.

Aruna glanced at me through the mirror. "I am surprised you haven't asked me yet."

"Asked you what?" I said, puzzled.

"The answer you want to know about your dream," he replied.

"How do you know about my dream?" I asked, suddenly tense. Right, I should probably tell you guys about the dream I had. I saw my best friend Aryan in a weird cave, scared out of his wits, with Kabandha—a demon with no head or neck, just one large eye on the chest and a mouth on the stomach—lurking outside the cave.

Aruna's voice broke into my thoughts. "The answers you seek are 25 55 67 89."

Before I could ask what that meant, the taxi came to a sudden stop. "We have arrived," Aruna announced.

We stepped out of the taxi, and it disappeared as swiftly as it had appeared. We looked over the Half-Blood Hill, and to our horror, I saw two mechanical bulls attacking the camp.

The sight was terrifying. The bulls were huge, with metal plates clanking and steam billowing from their nostrils. Campers were trying to fend them off, but it was clear they were struggling.

"Ashley, we need to help them!" I shouted.

She nodded, determination in her eyes. "Let's go."

As we ran towards the chaos, I couldn't help but think about the numbers Aruna had given me. What did they mean? And how were they connected to Aryan and the danger he was in? But for now, all that mattered was stopping those bulls and protecting our home.
