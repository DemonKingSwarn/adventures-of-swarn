### Chapter 8: An Unexpected Visit

That night, I sat alone on the beach, gazing out at the moonlit waves. The rhythmic sound of the ocean always calmed me, especially when the camp was in such turmoil. Lost in thought, I almost didn’t notice the fat man in jogging clothes who approached me.

“Hello,” he said.

You’d be surprised how many pizza delivery men get lost and accidentally stumble upon Camp Half-Blood. They never make it far, as the borders usually send them back, but with the borders weakened, I assumed he had wandered further than usual.

But then he spoke again, and his voice carried an air of familiarity. “Young man, you don’t recognize me?”

I looked at him more closely and said, “You’re Ganesh, Sujan’s father.”

He chuckled. “Sujan’s father—that’s not how people usually describe me. God of travelers and god of thieves is generally how I’m introduced.”

A fat rat next to him squeaked, “Boss, you’re getting associated by that son of yours.”

Ignoring the rat, I asked, “Why are you here?”

I didn’t have much respect for the gods, even if the one standing before me was essentially my half-brother. Ganesh didn’t seem to mind my tone. “Little brother, I—”

“I am not little and I am not your brother,” I cut him off.

He continued unfazed. “You’re running late. That ship you need to catch—I brought some supplies.”

He handed me a steel flask that felt cold to the touch and a bottle of multivitamins. “This flask contains the north wind, and my multivitamins will protect you from magic. Use them wisely.”

I frowned. “Why do I need to catch that ship?”

“Your friend, and my son, is there,” he replied.

“Sujan? You want me to bring him back?”

Ganesh shook his head. “Just talk to him. And maybe on this journey, you’ll also find that goat friend of yours and Ausadhirdipyamanas. But be careful.”

I heard footsteps approaching and turned to see Ashley coming towards us. As she drew closer, Ganesh vanished in a bright light, revealing his true form. I looked away just in time, knowing that to gaze upon a god’s true form would burn me to ashes.

When I turned back, Ashley was standing there, looking bewildered. “We need to go, like right NOW,” I told her.

We stood there, staring at each other, the urgency of our mission sinking in. The camp was in peril, and time was running out.
