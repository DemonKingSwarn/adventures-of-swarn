### Chapter 5: Sworn Oaths and Farewells

Upon reaching the Big House, I immediately blurted out the question that had been gnawing at me since the attack, "Where's Aryan?"

Aberforth sighed, a weary look in his eyes. "He's not around, Swarn. He has an urgent mission, and I can't disclose its details. But whatever it is, it's important."

A pang of worry settled in my chest, but I nodded, trusting that Aryan would be alright. Aberforth turned his attention back to me. "Swarn, you must promise me not to do anything reckless. Stay at camp, focus on your training, and improve your skills."

I nodded reluctantly, understanding the gravity of his words. He then turned to Ashley, his expression softening. "Ashley, you must keep Swarn safe."

"I will," she said resolutely.

Aberforth’s gaze hardened. "Swear upon the holy river that flows in Narak, the Vaitarani. Breaking an oath made on its name can lead to terrible consequences."

Ashley’s eyes widened, but she didn’t hesitate. "I swear upon the river Vaitarani to keep Swarn safe."

A clap of thunder echoed in the distance, sealing her oath. The solemnity of the moment was broken by Aberforth's next revelation.

"In light of the poisoning, Savitr has decided to remove me from my position. He has no one else to blame and needs to distance himself from Vishnu's wrath."

Ashley’s face crumpled, tears streaming down her cheeks as she hugged Aberforth tightly. He gently ruffled her hair, a paternal gesture that made my heart ache.

"Aberforth," Ashley choked out, "the Big Three made you immortal to train heroes. If you leave, then..."

She couldn’t finish her sentence, but we all understood the implication. Aberforth smiled sadly. "Perhaps, my dear. Or perhaps I will return once Savitr finds the real culprit."

My mind immediately flashed to Sujan, the traitor who had betrayed us last summer. "It was Sujan, wasn't it?" I asked.

Aberforth nodded. "He is a prime suspect. Stay vigilant."

With those parting words, Aberforth left the Big House, leaving Ashley and me standing there, feeling more alone than ever.

The weight of everything hung heavily in the air—the poisoned tree, the loss of Aberforth, the oath Ashley had taken. I looked at her, standing beside me, her eyes still glistening with tears. She met my gaze and gave a small, determined nod.

"We'll find a way," I said softly, taking her hand. "We'll save the camp, and we'll bring Aberforth back."

Ashley squeezed my hand, her grip firm. "Together."

And so, we stood there in the Big House, two demigods with a world of responsibilities on our shoulders, ready to face whatever came next.
