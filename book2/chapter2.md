### Chapter 2: A Familiar Face

There was no one behind me. Still suspicious, I continued towards my new school, Merry Weather High. I'm in 7th grade now and have just turned thirteen as my birthday on April 7th had recently passed. When I reached my school, I went to my class and sat at my regular desk at the front. I opened my books and saw a picture of Ashley, which she had emailed me and I had printed out. She was wearing a yellow dress with her arms folded in it. Looking at the picture made me realize how much I missed her.

Then they came, the three kids who always bullied me here. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, this kid gets bullied in every school. They snatched Ashley's picture and started making fun of her, which made me angry, but I had to sit silently because I didn't want to mess things up. I had already been to too many schools because of incidents like this, and I didn't want to get expelled again.

When it was time for gym class, I and my bullies were on opposite teams, playing volleyball. That's when things took a turn for the worse. My bullies started transforming into weird-looking giants. Thankfully, the Mist ensured that the normal humans in my school couldn't see their giant form. I was in my gym shorts, so my pen, which is actually a sword as you remember, wasn't in my pocket. I was struggling to fight them as they caused chaos, even exploding the generator room and causing a fire.

Just when I thought I was done for, a flash of silver pierced through the giant's back. The giant turned to ash, and I saw who had saved me. It was Ashley.

She stood there, breathing heavily but with a fierce look in her eyes. "Miss me?" she asked with a smirk.

"Ashley! What are you doing here?" I exclaimed, both relieved and surprised.

"No time to explain," she said, looking around at the chaos. "We've got to get out of here before anyone else gets hurt."

We hurried out of the school, the fire alarm blaring behind us. Students and teachers were evacuating, chaos all around. Once we were safely outside, I turned to Ashley, my heart still racing. "How did you find me?"

"I've been keeping tabs on you," she admitted. "Aberforth told me about the complications at camp, and I knew I had to get to you before things got worse."

"Is it because of Sujan?" I asked, my voice dropping to a whisper.

Ashley hesitated, avoiding my gaze. "I don't know," she finally said, but her hesitation told me otherwise.

"We need to get back to camp," I said, determination setting in.

"Agreed," Ashley said. "But first, let's get you home to grab your things. We don't have much time."

We hurried to my house, and I quickly packed my bag. My mom was surprised to see Ashley and immediately jumped to conclusions. "Is this your girlfriend?" she asked with a teasing smile.

"Mom, no!" I said, blushing furiously. "She's just a friend."

Ashley chuckled softly, and my mom just winked at me. "Be careful," she said, hugging me tightly.

"I will, Mom," I promised. "I'll be back soon."

With Ashley by my side, we headed out. I couldn't shake the feeling that this summer was going to be even more challenging than the last, but with Ashley and Aryan, I knew we'd face whatever came our way together.
