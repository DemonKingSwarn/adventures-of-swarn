### Chapter 4: The Poisoned Tree

Ashley and I sprinted towards the camp, a mix of urgency and confusion driving us. The sight of the mechanical bulls within the camp’s boundaries was alarming. These monstrosities shouldn't have been able to cross the magical borders created by Sophie's tree.

Ria, the mean daughter of Kartikeya, the god of war, was among the other demigods fighting off the bulls. I still couldn't forget our previous encounters, her disdain for me palpable. Nevertheless, in the heat of battle, old grudges had to be set aside.

"Ashley, let's go!" I shouted, charging into the fray.

We joined the others in the struggle against the mechanical bulls. Their metal plating clanked loudly with every movement, and steam hissed from their nostrils, adding to the chaos. The fight was intense, and we were all struggling to hold our ground. Then, out of nowhere, Kartikeya himself appeared, wielding his spear with deadly precision. He cut through the bulls like they were made of butter.

Once the immediate threat was neutralized, Kartikeya looked at me with the same disdainful expression as before. The memory of our last encounter flashed in my mind—I had defeated him when I was just twelve years old. The tension between us was palpable. He was my half-brother, a full god, and still harbored a grudge from our last battle. Before anyone could speak, he disappeared, leaving us to deal with the aftermath.

"Check on the injured!" I called out, rushing to help a fellow camper who had taken a nasty blow.

As we moved from one wounded demigod to another, Ashley’s voice rang out, full of panic. "The tree! It's poisoned!"

I ran to where she stood, looking up at Sophie's pine tree. Its leaves were wilting, and an eerie, dark substance was seeping from its trunk. The sight was heart-wrenching.

"It's like she's dying all over again," Ashley whispered, tears in her eyes.

For those who might have forgotten, here’s a brief recap: Long ago, three demigods—Sujan, Sophie, and Ashley—along with the satyr Aryan, were being chased by monsters while trying to reach Camp Half-Blood. To give her friends a chance to escape, Sophie stood back to fight off the monsters. As she lay dying, her father, Vishnu, transformed her into a pine tree. This tree created the magical borders that have protected our camp ever since. But now, it was poisoned, and the borders were weakening.

I placed a comforting hand on Ashley’s shoulder. "We'll find a way to save her," I promised, though I had no idea how.

Abberforth, our camp director, approached us with a grim expression. "This is bad. If the tree dies, the camp will be vulnerable to all kinds of monsters."

"We need to find out who did this and why," I said, determination hardening my voice. "And we need to find a cure for the tree."

Abberforth nodded. "You two," he pointed to me and Ashley, "come to the Big House. We need to discuss our next move."

As we made our way to the Big House, my mind raced. The prophecy, Sujan's betrayal, the poisoned tree—everything was connected. But how? And who was behind this attack?

I glanced at Ashley, her face set in determination despite the tears still glistening in her eyes. Together, we would find a way to save Sophie's tree and protect our home. We had to.
