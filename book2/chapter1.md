### Chapter 1: The Return to Camp Half-Blood

This was the time of our next summer. I woke up in my bedroom, feeling a mix of excitement and anticipation. My stepfather, Gabe, wasn't there, which wasn't surprising. I should probably tell you what happened to him. Some of you might remember that after severing Manasa's head, I sent it to Swarg to the gods. Well, those gods returned it back to me, and then my mom used it to turn Gabe to stone. She sold him for money and threw Manasa's head into the bottom of a lake. That's how we got rid of my stepfather.

Anyway, I was preparing myself to go back to my favorite place in the world, Camp Half-Blood. For those of you who might be new, let me tell you that I am the son of Shiva. I am a half-blood, or sometimes they call us demigods. Half-god and half-human are realâ€”the Hindu mythology is very real and kicking.

I went to the kitchen to see my mom and sat for breakfast. Today was the last day of school before summer vacation started, and then I would be heading to camp. But something told me my mom didn't look happy about it.

"I think you should not go this summer," my mom said as she added, "the camp is not safe right now."

"How can it not be safe? I am a demigod, and the camp is like the safest place for me," I said.

My mom replied, "I got a call from Aberforth, and he told me that there are some complications in camp."

This made me sad because I had been waiting to go to camp all year, just to see Ashley. I finished my breakfast and left my house to go to school, but as I was walking on the streets, I felt a weird sensation that someone was watching me. So, I turned back to see.
