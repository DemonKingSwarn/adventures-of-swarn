### Chapter 6: A Cure and a Warning

Ashley was in her Saraswati cabin, furiously turning the pages of her numerous books. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, and her fingers moved with an urgency that spoke of the gravity of our situation. Finally, with a triumphant exclamation, she found what she was looking for. Without wasting a moment, she came running toward me.

I was sitting near the beach, my usual spot to find solace. The rhythmic lapping of the waves against the shore always calmed me, a reminder of my connection to my father Shiva and his ansh, Jalandhar. The beach was my sanctuary, a place where I could think clearly amidst the chaos.

Ashley arrived, slightly out of breath, her eyes alight with excitement and hope. "Swarn, I've found something! Ausadhirdipyamanas—it can heal anything, any illness. It can certainly cure Sophie's tree."

Her words sparked a flicker of hope within me. But then reality set in. "But where do we even begin to look for it? No one has ever managed to find it since it was lost."

Before Ashley could respond, I felt a strange sensation wash over me, a familiar but unsettling feeling. It was like the dream I had in the god-taxi, the one where I saw Aryan. This time, the dream was more vivid. Aryan was wearing a wedding gown—an odd and out-of-place detail. He was speaking to me directly, his voice urgent and strained. "He's coming, it's coming," he said.

In my dream, Aryan looked at me with a mixture of desperation and determination. "Swarn, listen carefully. I've established an empathy link with you. It's a deep connection that allows us to communicate across distances and even dreams. But it also means I can feel what you feel, and you can sense my emotions too."

I snapped back to reality and immediately shared this with Ashley. Her eyes widened in alarm. "Swarn, creating an empathy link with someone is hard. It must be a nightmare."

"No, it wasn't," I insisted. "He was talking to me, warning me. He said, 'He's coming, it's coming.'"

Ashley paused, her expression shifting from confusion to deep thought. She bit her lip, a habit she had when she was trying to piece something together. "Aryan must have established an empathy link with you, which means he’s trying to communicate something important. But who is 'he,' and what is 'it'?"

I could see the wheels turning in her mind as she tried to make sense of Aryan's cryptic message. The gravity of our situation hung heavy in the air, and the urgency to decipher Aryan’s warning added another layer of tension.

As Ashley stood there, lost in thought, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of anxiety and determination. We were on the brink of something significant, something that could change everything. And as we stood by the beach, the calm waves contrasting the turmoil in our hearts, we knew that whatever was coming, we had to be ready.
