### Chapter 9: Setting Sail

Before anyone could start searching for us, I turned to the sea, closed my eyes, and whispered, "Dad, can you ask that ansh of yours to help us catch this ship?" For a few moments, nothing happened. Then, suddenly, two beautiful stallions emerged from the waves.

"Hippocampi! They look majestic," Ashley exclaimed.

Hippocampi are mythological sea horse-like creatures. We quickly grabbed the supplies Ganesh had given us and mounted the hippocampi. They surged forward, cutting through the waves toward the cruise ship. I didn't want to think about why Sujan was on a cruise ship or how we were going to confront him. There wasn't even time to explain to Ashley what Ganesh and I had discussed.

At camp, I only had a few friendsâ€”Ashley and Aryan being two of them. The others were Pranalee, daughter of Vishwakarma (the god of craftsmen), and Aditya, son of Surya (the sun god). Whenever I was around Pranalee, Ashley would get all worked up for some reason I didn't quite understand.

We reached the ship, and our dyslexic nature hardly managed to read its name: "PRINCESS DEVYANI." We climbed aboard, bid farewell to the hippocampi, and found an empty room. We locked the door behind us.

"We'll talk about this whole running away thing tomorrow morning," Ashley said, her voice tinged with exhaustion.

We both collapsed onto the beds and fell asleep almost instantly, the events of the day catching up to us.
