### Chapter 7: The Call to Quest

The next evening at the campfire, we all gathered in an attempt to lift our spirits. The usual joy and laughter were overshadowed by the grim reality that Sophie's tree was dying, and the magical borders of Camp Half-Blood were weakening. The sense of impending doom was palpable, and everyone tried to mask their fear with forced smiles and half-hearted singing.

As the flames flickered and cast long shadows, I couldn't shake the feeling that we needed to do something—anything—to save the camp. Suddenly, an idea struck me. I stood up abruptly, feeling a surge of determination. To my surprise, Ashley stood up at the same time, as if she had read my mind. We spoke in unison, our voices carrying over the crackling fire.

"We need a quest," we declared.

The camp fell silent, all eyes on us. Ashley continued, her voice steady and confident. "I know what can save Sophie's tree. It's the Ausadhirdipyamanas."

There was a murmur of confusion and curiosity. Ashley nudged me, signaling for me to share the crucial piece of information.

"25 55 67 89," I announced, feeling the weight of those numbers. "Those are coordinates."

Savitr, the camp's director and a powerful deity, chuckled skeptically. "What are those again?"

"Coordinates," I repeated firmly.

Savitr's amusement faded, replaced by a look of scrutiny. "Why should we trust y—"

Before he could finish his sentence, the campers erupted in a unified chant. "WE NEED A QUEST! WE NEED A QUEST!"

The energy was electric, and the voices of my fellow demigods drowned out any further objections. Savitr's gaze shifted from skeptical to resigned, realizing that the collective will of the camp was undeniable.

"Fine," he conceded. "A quest it is."

He scanned the crowd, and his eyes landed on Ria, the fierce and often aloof daughter of Kartikeya. "Ria, you're coming with me."

Ria looked momentarily surprised but quickly masked it with her usual stoic expression. She nodded and followed Savitr as they both headed toward the Big House. The campfire's light cast their long shadows on the ground, making them appear larger than life.

As they disappeared into the Big House, the camp buzzed with excitement and apprehension. The quest was real, and the stakes were higher than ever. We knew that the journey ahead would be fraught with danger, but it was our only hope to save Sophie's tree and restore the camp's magical protection.

Ashley and I exchanged a determined glance. This was just the beginning, and we were ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
