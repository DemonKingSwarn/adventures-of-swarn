### Chapter 15: The Betrayal

Sitting in the woods, Sujan and I were deep in conversation. The tranquility of the moment shattered when a sharp pain pierced my skin. I looked down to see a scorpion scurrying away. "Ouch!" I yelped, rubbing my hand.

Sujan's face twisted into a smirk. "I wasn't hoping for you to return that crown to Indra. It was meant to go to Kali in that pit where she is scattered into pieces, plotting her revenge on the gods."

Shock and disbelief coursed through me. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks. "You shall be betrayed by the one who calls you friend," the prophecy had warned. It was Sujan all along. My supposed friend, who had trained and guided me, had been the traitor.

Before I could react, Sujan opened a ripple in the air and disappeared. I felt the venom from the scorpion sting spreading through my body. Desperation took over, and I sprinted towards the lake, hoping its waters could heal me as they had before. But this time, the waters offered no relief.

My vision blurred, and my legs wobbled. Summoning every ounce of strength, I stumbled towards the Big House. As I neared, I saw Ashley and collapsed into her arms. Her presence was a beacon of hope in my darkening world. Just as she had done when I first arrived at camp, Ashley nursed me back to health. She fed me nectar and ambrosia, the food of the gods, with its potent healing properties. Slowly, the venom's grip loosened.

"Thank you, Ashley," I murmured, feeling the strength return to my limbs.

We went inside and I recounted the betrayal. "Sujan was the one who stole Indra's crown," I said, looking into Abberforth's eyes. "He's working for Kali."

Ashley’s face fell, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Sujan was like a brother to me. How could he do this?" 

I put a comforting hand on her shoulder. "We couldn't have known. He deceived us all."

Ashley and I walked out of the infirmary together, the weight of recent events hanging heavily between us. "I need to go home," she said softly. "It's been a while, and I think I need to be with my family. You gave me the courage to face my past, Swarn."

She hugged me tightly, and before I could say anything, she pressed a gentle kiss on my cheek. "Goodbye," she whispered, and then she was gone.

Feeling a mix of sadness and resolve, I made my decision. With the immediate threat gone and nothing tying me to the camp year-round, I, too, chose to return home. I needed to process everything that had happened, to come to terms with the betrayal and the realization of my true parentage.

As I packed my things, memories of the camp flooded my mind—the friendships, the battles, the discoveries. Despite the pain and betrayal, I knew I had grown stronger. The journey had only just begun, and I had a destiny to fulfill, but for now, home called to me.

Leaving camp behind, I set out, ready to face whatever the future held.
