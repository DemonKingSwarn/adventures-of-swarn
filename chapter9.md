### Chapter 9: Encounter with Manasa

As we ventured deeper into the unfamiliar forest, Aryan's keen sense of smell led us to a tantalizing aroma—someone was cooking hamburgers nearby. Following Aryan's lead, Ashley and I followed him until we stumbled upon a peculiar house surrounded by stone statues. Dyslexic as we were, the sign on the door appeared as a jumble of letters to us.

"What the hell does that say?" I muttered in frustration, trying to decipher the words.

Aryan chuckled. "It says 'Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Emporium.'"

With a shrug, we knocked on the door, and it swung open to reveal a middle-eastern woman with a cloth covering her eyes. Inviting us inside, she served us a delicious meal, and we eagerly dug in, our hunger outweighing our curiosity.

Midway through the meal, the woman asked for a photograph. Confused but compliant, we posed outside, only to freeze in horror as she began to remove the cloth covering her eyes. Before she could reveal her gaze, I caught sight of her snake-like hair, and Ashley's warning confirmed my suspicion—she was Manasa, the goddess of snakes.

In a panic, we scrambled to hide, but Manasa began to search for us, her deadly gaze capable of turning us to stone with a single glance. Thinking quickly, I uncapped my pen, and it transformed into a sword. Unable to look directly at her, I used her reflection to guide my strike, severing her head with a swift blow.

With Manasa defeated, I seized upon an idea. Gathering her severed head, I made my way to her office and placed it inside a box, intending to send it to Swarg—the 600th floor of the Empire State Building. Leaving a golden drachma as payment, I invoked the name of Devarishi Narad, the messenger of the gods, and sealed the box.

With our unexpected encounter behind us, we hurried out of Manasa's home and resumed our quest, the weight of our recent confrontation lingering in the air. But as we pressed onward, I couldn't shake the feeling that our journey was far from over, and that more challenges awaited us on the path ahead.
