### Chapter 5: The Training Begins

The next morning, I sought out Aberforth, anxious to explain that I'd lost his pen-sword. "I lost your pen," I confessed, feeling a knot of guilt in my stomach.

Aberforth smiled gently. "Check your pockets."

Confused, I reached into my pocket and pulled out the familiar pen. "How...?"

"Unless you surrender it willingly, it will always return to you," he explained, his eyes twinkling with amusement.

That afternoon, Sujan took me to the training grounds to practice sword fighting. I uncapped my pen, and to my surprise, the sword felt natural in my hand. Sujan watched me with a critical eye, offering tips and corrections. Despite my inexperience, I found myself moving with surprising agility and precision.

"You’re doing well," Sujan said, nodding approvingly. "You’ve got a knack for this."

As we took a break, Sujan shared more about his time at the camp. "I came here seven years ago with Ashley and another demigod named Sophie. She was incredibly brave. We wouldn't have made it without her. When we were being chased by monsters, Sophie stayed back to give us time to reach safety. The tree on Half-Blood Hill? That’s her. Vishnu, her father, transformed her into that tree to protect the camp. Her presence keeps the camp safe so no one else has to face what she did."

The weight of Sujan's words settled over me. The tree wasn't just a landmark; it was a symbol of sacrifice and protection. "Sophie was the daughter of Vishnu?" I asked, feeling a pang of sadness.

Sujan nodded. "Yeah, one of the Big Three. Her sacrifice ensures that we’re all safe here."

After our sword practice, Ashley met me for my first Sanskrit lesson. She explained that demigods often have dyslexia because our brains are hardwired for ancient languages like Sanskrit. Our ADHD, she added, is actually an asset in battle, keeping us alert and ready for action.

Ashley started with basic phrases, her patience evident as I stumbled over the unfamiliar syllables. "Don’t worry," she reassured me. "You’ll get the hang of it."

As the lesson continued, I found myself more at ease. There was something comforting about the rhythmic flow of the language, and I could see why it felt natural to me. It was as if a part of my heritage was awakening, helping me connect with a world I was only just beginning to understand.

By the end of the day, I was exhausted but content. The camp was becoming more familiar, and the people around me—Sujan, Ashley, and even Aberforth—were becoming more than just fellow campers. They were becoming friends and allies in this strange new life.

That night, as I lay in my bunk in Cabin 9, I thought about everything I'd learned. The myths and stories I’d read about were real, and I was a part of them. My father was out there somewhere, a god among gods, and I had a role to play in this unfolding narrative.

I closed my eyes, determined to embrace my destiny, whatever it might be. I was ready to learn, to train, and to prove myself. With friends by my side and a newfound sense of purpose, I knew I could face whatever challenges lay ahead.

The next day, my journey at Camp Half-Blood would continue, and I was eager to see where it would lead.
