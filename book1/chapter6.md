### Chapter 6: Capture the Flag

The next day, the camp was buzzing with excitement as preparations for the game of Capture the Flag began. I was assigned to Ashley's team, and to my relief, Sujan was on our team as well. We were the Blue Team, and having my friends with me gave me a boost of confidence. However, my stomach knotted when I saw Ria, the fierce daughter of Kartikeya, on the Red Team. Her reputation and the memory of our encounter made me uneasy.

The game began, and the forest was soon filled with the sounds of battle—clashing swords, shouted commands, and the rustle of underbrush as we moved strategically through the trees. Our team was holding its own when Ria and her allies ambushed us. Her intense gaze locked onto me as she charged.

I fought back, tapping into the skills Sujan had taught me, but something strange happened. As the battle intensified, I felt a surge of power coursing through my veins. My movements became faster, my strikes more precise. One by one, I took down Ria's allies until only she remained. The look of shock on her face was mirrored by my own disbelief at what I had just done.

Suddenly, a giant trident materialized above my head, glowing with an otherworldly light. Everyone froze, their eyes widening in awe and confusion. Ashley, standing nearby, looked up at the trident and then at me. "Your dad's calling," she said with a hint of awe.

Before I could process her words, Aberforth's voice rang out, filled with authority. "Kneel, everyone! Swarn has been claimed by Shiva, the god of destruction."

Gasps and murmurs spread through the camp as everyone, including Ria, knelt before me. I stood there, stunned. My dad is a Big Three god? Aberforth continued, "Swarn, son of Shiva, as the forbidden child of the destruction god, you are singular among other demigods."

The weight of his words sank in. Shiva, the god of destruction, was my father. The implications were overwhelming. I had gone from being an unclaimed demigod to being the son of one of the most powerful gods in the Hindu pantheon.

After the ceremony, I was moved to Cabin 1, the cabin reserved for children of Shiva. As I stepped inside, the solitude hit me. The cabin was grand and adorned with symbols of destruction and rebirth, but it felt empty. I had grown used to the camaraderie of Cabin 9, and now I was alone.

That night, I lay on the bed in my new cabin, staring at the ceiling. The events of the day played over and over in my mind. I was no longer just Swarn; I was Swarn, son of Shiva. The realization was both exhilarating and daunting. I thought about my mom and how much she had sacrificed for me. I wished she could see me now and wondered if she had known this would happen.

A knock on the door interrupted my thoughts. It was Ashley and Sujan, bringing a sense of familiarity and comfort. "We thought you might need some company," Ashley said with a smile.

Sujan nodded. "It's a lot to take in, but we’re here for you."

Their presence was a relief. We sat and talked about everything—our training, the capture the flag game, and what it meant for me to be the son of Shiva. Ashley shared stories about other demigods who had faced similar challenges, and Sujan reassured me that I wasn't alone.

The next morning, I awoke with a renewed sense of purpose. I wasn't just here to survive; I was here to honor my mother's memory and to live up to the legacy of my father. There was much to learn and many challenges ahead, but with friends like Ashley and Sujan by my side, I felt ready to face them.

As I stepped out of Cabin 1, the sun rising over the camp, I knew that my journey was just beginning. I was no longer the confused boy who stumbled into this world; I was Swarn, son of Shiva, and I was ready to embrace my destiny.
