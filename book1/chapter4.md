### Chapter 4: New Beginnings

I stepped out of the infirmary, blinking in the bright sunlight. The camp was a hive of activity, with kids of all ages training, talking, and going about their day. As I scanned the scene, I spotted Mr. Sharma, or rather Aberforth, playing pinochle with a man who had a big bushy beard. Beside Aberforth was a girl with pitch-black eyes that seemed to hold endless wisdom, her black hair cascading in curls around her fair face. She looked like a princess straight out of a storybook.

I approached Mr. Sharma—Aberforth, I corrected myself—and he greeted me with a smile. "It's nice that you are finally awake," he said, pointing to the girl. "This young woman helped nurse you back to health."

The girl smiled and said, "I'm Ashley." Her voice was warm and kind, and it was the first time I ever talked to a girl who wasn't mean to me. Blushing, I quickly replied, "I'm Swarn."

Ashley grinned mischievously. "You drool in your sleep," she teased, causing my cheeks to turn even redder.

Aberforth then stood up from his wheelchair, and to my astonishment, revealed that he was a centaur. I turned to the bearded man playing cards with him, and Aberforth introduced him. "This man is Savitr, the god of speed."

Savitr nodded at me, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "Welcome, Swarn."

Aberforth then asked Ashley to show me around the camp. As we walked, she explained more about the camp and its residents. "The Hindu gods often have children with mortals, not just the male gods but the female gods too. I'm the daughter of Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom."

That explained the wisdom in her eyes. She showed me the cabins where the campers lived, each cabin corresponding to the demigod's divine parent. "If you're unclaimed, you stay in Cabin 9, Ganesh's cabin, as he's the god of travelers. The big three gods—Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma—have their own cabins, but they're empty because they vowed never to have demigod children."

As we walked, a girl who looked quite mean bumped into me, almost knocking me over. Ashley helped me up. "She seems nice," I muttered sarcastically.

"That's Ria, daughter of Kartikeya, the god of war," Ashley explained.

"Great," I sighed. "So, which cabin is mine?"

Ashley looked at me sympathetically. "You're unclaimed, so you'll be in Cabin 9, Ganesh's cabin."

A pang of sadness hit me. I needed my dad now more than ever, especially after what happened to my mom. But he was still not around, and it felt like he didn't want me. Ashley went to get my stuff, and I made my way to Cabin 9.

Inside, the cabin was cozy and welcoming, filled with various travel memorabilia and statues of Ganesh. A boy with a scar on his right eye, a bit taller than me, approached. He extended his hand. "I'm Sujan, son of Ganesh."

I shook his hand. "I'm Swarn."

"Welcome to Cabin 9, Swarn. It's not so bad being unclaimed. We take care of each other here," Sujan said with a reassuring smile.

I nodded, feeling a bit better. Maybe this place could be a new beginning for me, a place where I could learn more about my heritage and find a sense of belonging. As I settled in, I couldn't help but think about my mom's sacrifice and the promise I made to myself. I was determined to find out who my father was and to honor my mother's memory by becoming the best version of myself.

That evening, after unpacking my things, I joined the rest of the camp for dinner. We gathered around a large bonfire, the flames dancing and casting warm light on the faces of my fellow campers. I listened to their stories, their laughter, and their hopes, feeling a strange mix of apprehension and excitement about the journey ahead.

As the night deepened, Ashley found me again. "How are you holding up?" she asked gently.

"I'm okay," I said, though my voice wavered slightly. "It's a lot to take in."

She nodded understandingly. "It is, but you're not alone. We're all in this together."

For the first time since arriving at Camp Half-Blood, I felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, I could find my place here. And with friends like Ashley and Sujan, I wouldn't have to face this new world alone.
