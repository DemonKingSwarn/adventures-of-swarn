### Chapter 12: Blessings and Laughter

The next morning, as the truck rolled into Las Vegas, we freed the animals from their cages. The lion, zebra, and black bear bounded out, each heading in different directions, tasting freedom for the first time in who knows how long. Aryan muttered something under his breath.

"What did you say?" I asked.

"I gave them the satyr's blessing," Aryan replied. "It will protect them."

"Can you do that on us?" I asked curiously.

"It only works on animals," he replied with a hint of regret.

"So it will only work on Swarn," Ashley said with a chuckle.

Instead of getting angry at her words, I found myself not minding them at all. As she laughed, I couldn't help but notice how beautiful she looked, her joy making her eyes sparkle. My face grew warm, and I felt myself blushing.

We continued walking through the bustling streets of Las Vegas, feeling somewhat out of place amidst the glitz and glamor. The neon lights and constant noise were overwhelming, but we pressed on until we spotted a taxi. The driver, an older man with kind eyes, looked at us with curiosity as we piled in.

I handed him the credit card Kartikeya had given us and swiped it on his machine. To our surprise, the machine displayed an infinity sign. The driverâ€™s eyes widened in recognition, and he bowed slightly to Ashley. Clearly, this was no ordinary credit card.

"Los Angeles," we said in unison, and the driver nodded, starting the car.

As we drove, the city's bright lights faded into the distance, replaced by the open road and the vast desert. The journey was long, but the driver kept up a steady pace, the taxi eating up the miles.

The journey gave us time to reflect and regroup. We shared stories, laughed, and even sang along to some of the driver's old tunes, trying to keep our spirits high.

As we neared Los Angeles, the sun began to set, casting a golden hue over everything. The city of angels lay ahead, promising new challenges and dangers. But with each other, we felt ready to face whatever came next.

Finally, the taxi pulled up to the outskirts of Los Angeles. We stepped out, feeling a mixture of anticipation and anxiety. The city sprawled out before us, vast and full of life.

"Let's find that entrance," I said, determination in my voice.

With a nod from Aryan and a smile from Ashley, we began our search, ready to delve deeper into the mysteries that lay ahead.
