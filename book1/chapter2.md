### Chapter 2: The Revelation

Aryan decided to come home with me. As we sat on the bus, he handed me a card and said, "In case you want to contact me." The card read, "Camp Half-Blood, New York," which left me puzzled. Did Aryan have a summer home or something?

Let me explain how Aryan looked: he had long hair that he always tucked under a beanie, and he always wore full-length pants, even on the hottest days. He managed to get out of gym class by convincing the teachers he had a limp. He was the only sixth grader I'd ever seen with acne, which made me wonder if he'd been held back a few grades. Then he said something that took me by surprise: "I am your protector."

That made me angry. I had always stood up for Aryan whenever anyone picked on him. How could he claim to be my protector? Our bus came to a stop, still far from my home in Manhattan. We got off at a small, run-down bus stop, and at an old stall nearby, we saw three old women knitting a sock. The middle one cut the thread from the yarn, which for some reason terrified Aryan. I saw fear in his eyes like I had never seen before.

"Wait here," Aryan said, and he darted into a nearby bathroom. But I didn't wait. Frustrated and confused, I continued on my own until I finally reached my small apartment.

When I entered, my stepfather, Gabe Ugliano, was playing poker with a bunch of his friends. Gabe is a fat, greasy guy who smells like a sewer. I have no idea why my mom married him. She always told me that she met my real dad while trekking, but he left because of some business he had to attend to.

Gabe shouted at me as I walked through the door. I ignored him and went straight to my room. A few moments later, my mom, Sarah, entered and locked the door behind her. She had a dish of kheer, my favorite dessert, in her hands. She hugged me tightly and said that since I was home early, we could go to our mountain house, just the two of us. I loved our mountain house. It was a place of peace, away from the chaos of the city and the stench of Gabe.

We packed quickly and headed to the car. As we were leaving, Gabe grabbed my shirt and growled, "If you scratch the car, you're dead." I glared at him and pulled away. My mom and I got into the car and drove towards the mountains. 

That night, as we sat in front of the fire, I recounted the bizarre events of my field trip to her. She listened quietly, and when I finished, she took a deep breath. "Swarn, there's something you need to know. Your dad isn't a man. He's a god."

I stared at her, my mind racing. "There is no such thing as gods," I insisted. "There are no monsters, and I know for sure there are no demigods. I know I'm broken, and there might be something really wrong with me, but gods? That's too much."

My mom sighed and looked at me with a mix of sadness and determination. Before she could respond, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to find Aryan standing there, but something was different. His beanie was gone, revealing small horns on his forehead, and below the waist, he had the legs of a goat.

"Swarn, we need to talk," Aryan said, his voice urgent and filled with an intensity I had never heard before.

I stumbled back, my mind struggling to process what I was seeing. "Aryan, what...what are you?"

"I'm a satyr," he replied calmly, as if this was the most normal thing in the world. "And there's a lot you need to understand about who you are."

I looked at my mom, seeking some sort of explanation, but she only nodded. "It's true, Swarn. Your father is a god, and your life is about to change in ways you can't imagine."

The reality of my situation began to sink in. I wasn't just a kid with dyslexia and ADHD. I was the child of a god, and this revelation opened the door to a world I never knew existedâ€”a world where myths and legends were real, and where my destiny was waiting to unfold.
