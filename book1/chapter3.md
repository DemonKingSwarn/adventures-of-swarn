### Chapter 3: The Awakening

The car roared to life as my mom, Aryan, and I sped down the highway, leaving the chaos of the city behind. The weight of my newfound identity pressed heavily on me, a torrent of questions swirling in my mind. Finally, I mustered the courage to ask, "How can I be a demigod?"

Aryan turned to me, his expression serious. "You know about Hindu mythology, right? Those gods move with the western civilization where their strong suits are. Right now, they're here in America, and their Swarg is at the top of the secret 600th floor of the Empire State Building. From time to time, the gods come down and have kids with mortals. We call those kids demigods—half-god and half-human. Normal humans can't see the mythical world because of the Mist, which hides it from their view. Demigods aren't safe in the human world because monsters can smell their scent. That's why Camp Half-Blood exists. No monster can cross its magical borders. It's a safe haven for demigods like you."

My head spun with this revelation. "Then which god is my dad?" I asked, my voice trembling with both fear and curiosity.

Before Aryan could answer, a loud roar echoed through the night. I turned to see a massive figure charging towards us—a Minotaur, its eyes blazing with fury. Panic surged through me as the beast closed in. My mom's grip on the steering wheel tightened, and she swerved to avoid it, but the Minotaur slammed into the car, sending us careening off the road and into the forest.

The car rolled, and I felt myself being tossed around like a rag doll. When it finally came to a stop, we scrambled out through the shattered windows. Aryan's voice was urgent, "The northern entrance to the camp is close. Keep running!"

My mom, ever brave, had an idea to buy us some time. She hugged me tightly, then took my jacket and began to distract the Minotaur, luring it away from us. "Go, Swarn! Run!" she shouted.

Horror filled my heart as I watched her. The Minotaur caught up to her, its massive hands crushing her in an instant. She disintegrated into a golden mist, leaving only her essence behind. Grief and rage surged through me, a powerful combination that gave me strength. I uncapped the pen Mr. Sharma had given me, and it transformed into a sword.

Fueled by adrenaline, I faced the Minotaur. The beast charged, and I met it head-on. I managed a few strikes before it rammed me with its horns, sending me sprawling to the ground. My sword slipped from my grasp. Desperation fueled my next move. I leapt onto the Minotaur's back, using every ounce of strength to yank one of its horns free. With a primal scream, I plunged the horn into the creature's neck. The Minotaur bellowed in agony before disintegrating into ash, leaving only its horn in my hand.

Exhausted and grief-stricken, I turned to Aryan. He nodded, understanding the pain and determination in my eyes. We made our way towards the camp, a towering structure looming in the distance. Each step was heavy, my body aching from the fight and the loss of my mother.

As we reached the stairs of the big building at the camp, my vision blurred. The adrenaline that had sustained me was now gone, and darkness closed in. I collapsed, unconscious, my last thought a whispered promise to find out more about my father and to protect those I cared about.

When I awoke, I found myself in a cozy infirmary, soft sunlight filtering through the windows. The scent of herbs filled the air. Aryan was sitting nearby, his worried expression relaxing as he saw me stir.

"Welcome to Camp Half-Blood," he said softly.

I tried to sit up, wincing at the pain in my body. "What happened?"

"You passed out from the adrenaline rush," Aryan explained. "You're safe now. This is where you'll learn about your heritage, train to control your powers, and prepare for the challenges ahead."

A sense of determination filled me. My mother's sacrifice, Aryan's loyalty, and the mysteries of my father's identity all fueled my resolve. I was ready to embrace my destiny, whatever it might be.
