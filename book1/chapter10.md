### Chapter 10: The Sting of the Chimera

As our journey continued, Ashley, Aryan, and I boarded a train heading west. The rhythmic clatter of the tracks beneath us provided a temporary sense of security. However, it wasn’t long before our peace was disrupted. Diti, the formidable mother of all asuras, appeared. Her presence radiated an unsettling power, and when we locked eyes, I could sense the ancient malice within her.

The encounter quickly escalated when one of her offspring, a chimera, began chasing us through the train. To the ordinary passengers, thanks to the mist, the chimera appeared as nothing more than an unusually aggressive chihuahua. But we knew the truth, and it was far more terrifying. In the chaos, the chimera managed to sting me with its venomous tail, and a burning pain seared through my leg.

We somehow managed to escape the train and found ourselves in St. Louis, standing before the iconic Gateway Arch. Ashley, ever the daughter of Saraswati, couldn’t help but share random facts about its symmetrical design, perhaps as a way to distract us from our predicament.

Suddenly, I felt the venom taking its toll. My vision blurred, and I collapsed. Ashley, always quick to think on her feet, remembered a story about Jalandhar, an ansh (fragment) of Shiva born from the sea, and how the water had healing properties. She dragged me to a nearby fountain, hoping that its waters might offer some relief. But as she splashed the stagnant water over my wound, she realized it wasn’t enough.

“Maybe it needs to be naturally flowing water,” she said, her voice tinged with desperation.

As if on cue, we saw Diti and her chimera approaching us in the distance. Panic set in, and we made a dash for the Arch. We entered the elevator, but I knew that facing Diti and the chimera in such a confined space would spell doom for all of us. As the elevator doors began to close, I tricked my friends and slipped out, locking them inside to ensure their safety.

The battle at the top of the Arch was brutal. Diti’s laughter echoed ominously as the chimera lunged at me. My sword clashed against its claws, but the creature was relentless. In the heat of the struggle, the chimera tore a hole in the side of the Arch, revealing the dizzying height above the ground and the river below.

With a mighty shove, the chimera sent me tumbling through the gaping hole. I plummeted toward the earth, the wind rushing past me. The last thing I saw before blacking out was the river rising up to meet me, as if summoned by an unseen force.

When I came to, I found myself submerged in the river, cradled by its gentle currents. I realized with awe that I could breathe underwater. The cool waters enveloped me, and I felt a soothing energy coursing through my body, healing the chimera’s venom. The river, acknowledging my connection to Jalandhar and Shiva, was restoring my strength.

I spent what felt like hours underwater, marveling at the newfound bond with the element. I could sense the river’s ancient wisdom, its memories of ages past flowing into me. When I finally emerged, I felt rejuvenated, as if reborn from the very waters that had saved me.

Climbing up the riverbank, I saw Ashley and Aryan rushing towards me, their faces a mix of relief and astonishment.

“You’re alive!” Ashley exclaimed, her eyes shining with unshed tears.

“And you can breathe underwater?” Aryan added, his expression a blend of awe and curiosity.

I nodded, still processing the extraordinary turn of events. “Yeah, I guess I can. Thanks to my connection with Jalandhar.”

We took a moment to regroup, the urgency of our quest pressing upon us once more. Despite the dangers we had faced, we knew that we had to keep moving. The encounter with Diti and the chimera had been a stark reminder of the perils that lay ahead, but it also showed us the strength we had within us.

Together, we continued our journey, the bond between us stronger than ever. We were determined to find Indra’s crown and fulfill the prophecy, no matter the challenges that awaited.
