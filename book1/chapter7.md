### Chapter 7: The Prophecy Unveiled

Curiosity gnawed at me, demanding answers about Sophie, the daughter of Vishnu who had sacrificed herself to protect the camp. I turned to Ashley and Sujan, seeking clarity. "What happened to Sophie? Why did she stay behind?"

Sujan's expression grew somber. "The children of the Big Three gods—Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma—are rare. Seventy years ago, the Big Three made an oath not to sire any more demigods, as their children were stronger than others. But Vishnu broke that oath when he had Sophie, and Shiva broke it when he had you."

"So, I'm a forbidden child now?" I muttered, the weight of the revelation settling heavily on my shoulders. "But I don't even know if I'm strong."

Ashley placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. "Strength isn't just about power, Swarn. It's about resilience, courage, and the willingness to face challenges head-on."

Her words brought me a measure of comfort, but the uncertainty still lingered. And why did looking at Ashley still make me blush like a schoolboy?

That afternoon, Aberforth summoned me to the attic of the big house, instructing me to retrieve a prophecy from the Akashvani. As I climbed the stairs, my mind buzzed with questions. What quest awaited me? What dangers lay ahead?

Entering the attic, I was greeted by an array of artifacts from past quests, each one imbued with its own tale of heroism and sacrifice. My eyes fell upon an ancient mummified figure, and I approached it tentatively.

"Hello? I'm Swarn," I began, my voice echoing in the dusty silence. "I was told to come here and receive a prophecy."

To my astonishment, the figure stirred, green mist swirling from its mouth as it spoke in a voice that seemed to echo from another realm. "You shall go west and face the god who has turned. Make sure what was stolen is returned safely. You shall be betrayed by the one who calls you friend and shall fail to save what matters most to you."

The words sent a chill down my spine, and I stumbled backward, my heart pounding in my chest. Hastily, I made my way downstairs to where Aberforth, Savitr, Ashley, and Aryan were waiting.

As I recounted the prophecy to them, a heavy silence descended over the room. Aberforth's brow furrowed in concern, while Ashley's eyes narrowed with determination.

"We must decipher the meaning of this prophecy," Aberforth said gravely. "But for now, be cautious, Swarn. Trust is a fragile thing, and betrayal often comes from the least expected places."

I nodded, the weight of the prophecy settling heavily on my shoulders. The journey ahead was fraught with uncertainty, but one thing was clear: I would need the support of my friends more than ever.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the camp, I couldn't shake the feeling of foreboding that lingered in the air. The prophecy had set the stage for a perilous journey, and I could only hope that with courage and determination, we would emerge victorious.

But as I settled into bed that night, sleep eluded me, and the words of the prophecy echoed in my mind, haunting me with their ominous warning.
