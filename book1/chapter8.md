### Chapter 8: The Quest Begins

The next morning dawned with a sense of urgency as I prepared to embark on the quest foretold by the prophecy. Aberforth had tasked me with choosing two companions, and though the decision weighed heavily on my mind, one choice came to me instinctively: Ashley. There was something about her unwavering courage and determination that made her the obvious choice.

For my second companion, I chose Aryan. Despite being a satyr, he had been my closest friend for as long as I could remember, and I trusted him with my life. Together, the three of us gathered our belongings and made our final preparations for the journey ahead.

As we stood at the edge of camp, Sujan approached, his expression grave. He handed me a gift from his father, Ganesh—winged sandals that shimmered with divine magic. I thanked him, tucking the sandals safely into my backpack.

Aberforth provided us with golden drachmas, ancient Hindu currency, and some human money for our journey. Our destination: Narak, the underworld, where we hoped to find Indra's stolen crown.

The entrance to Narak lay beneath the city of Los Angeles, so we set out on foot until we reached a nearby bus stop. Boarding the bus, we settled into our seats, discussing our plans for the quest ahead. But our conversation was cut short when three furies materialized before us, their terrifying forms obscured from the view of mortals by the mist.

Panic erupted on the bus as passengers scrambled to flee, but there was nowhere to run. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I unsheathed my pen-sword and prepared to face the furies head-on. Ashley and Aryan stood by my side, their determination matching my own.

In a blur of motion, we fought back against the furies, their claws slashing through the air with deadly precision. With each strike, we drew upon the skills we had honed at camp, working together as a team to fend off the relentless onslaught.

As the battle raged on, the bus erupted into chaos, and in a desperate bid for survival, we leaped through the windows just as the vehicle exploded behind us. Rolling onto the ground, we found ourselves in the midst of a dense forest—a stark contrast to the urban landscape we had left behind.

I glanced around in astonishment. I had no idea that such a vast wilderness existed in New Jersey. But there was no time to dwell on our surroundings. With the furies still in pursuit, we gathered our wits and prepared to continue our journey into the unknown.
