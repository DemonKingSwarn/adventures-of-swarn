### Chapter 1: The Unexpected

My name is Swarn, and I was on a field trip with my high school. We were geeking out on Hindu mythology, captivated by tales of gods and epic battles. It was an escape, a welcome distraction from the usual school grind. But before I dive into the bizarre events that unfolded, there's something you should know about me: I have dyslexia and ADHD. This means my world is a chaotic blend of jumbled words and restless thoughts, making school a constant struggle.

Our Hindu mythology teacher, Mr. Sharma, is a middle-aged guy confined to a wheelchair. He has this uncanny ability to make ancient stories come alive, transporting us to realms filled with deities and demons. His passion for the subject is infectious, and despite my learning difficulties, I found myself drawn into the rich tapestry of myths he wove.

After Mr. Sharma finished his lecture about the gods, we were given a lunch break. I sat with my best friend Aryan, a quiet guy with an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology. We often found solace in discussing the intricacies of these stories, which felt more tangible than the complexities of our everyday lives.

As we were munching on our sandwiches, Nancy, a girl who had made it her life’s mission to torment me since childhood, decided to make her presence known. She sauntered over and, with a smug grin, threw a slice of cheese at Aryan's head. The cheese stuck, and Aryan looked as though he had sprouted a yellow beret. Normally, I would have ignored her, having grown accustomed to her bullying. But something inside me snapped.

I stood up, feeling a surge of anger. Just as I was about to confront her, the ground seemed to shift. Before I could even lay a hand on her, the earth itself seemed to rise up, and Nancy was propelled backward into the nearby fountain. She emerged, drenched and sputtering, her arrogance replaced by bewilderment.

Our substitute teacher, Mrs. Elina, who seemed to relish finding reasons to punish me, immediately started calling my name. She had this way of singling me out, as if my very existence was an affront to her sense of order. "Swarn, meet me at the statue of Shiva," she commanded, her eyes glinting with anticipation of my impending punishment.

I nodded and trudged toward the statue, a sense of dread settling in my stomach. The statue of Shiva, the god of destruction and transformation, stood tall and imposing in the courtyard. It was an odd place for a reprimand, but nothing about this day was turning out to be normal.

As I reached the statue, Mrs. Elina followed, her demeanor shifting from stern to something more menacing. Suddenly, her form twisted and contorted, transforming into a fury—an ancient spirit of vengeance. Her voice became a harsh screech as she yelled, "Give it back! I know you stole it!"

Confusion and fear coursed through me. What was she talking about? Before I could respond, Mr. Sharma wheeled into the courtyard and, with surprising strength, threw a ballpoint pen at me. Instinctively, I caught it and uncapped it. To my astonishment, the pen transformed into a gleaming sword.

In a daze, I swung the sword at Mrs. Elina. She shrieked and, upon contact, disintegrated into a cloud of ash. I stood there, the sword reverting to its pen form, my mind racing to comprehend what had just happened.

Mr. Sharma had vanished as mysteriously as he had appeared. Had I imagined it all? The surreal nature of the encounter left me questioning my sanity. But the ash on the ground and the pen in my hand told a different story.

Naturally, the commotion drew the attention of the other teachers and students. I was promptly called to the headmaster's office. Despite my frantic explanations, my story sounded ludicrous. Convinced that I had caused some inexplicable trouble, the headmaster expelled me on the spot.

As I packed my belongings, Aryan approached me, his face a mix of concern and curiosity. "What happened back there?" he asked.

I shook my head, unable to form a coherent answer. "I don't know, Aryan. But I think we're about to find out."

With those words, my ordinary life was irrevocably altered, thrusting me into a world where myths and reality collided, and where my own hidden potential was yet to be discovered.
