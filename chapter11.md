### Chapter 11: The God of War and the Waterpark of Perils

We continued on our quest on foot, the recent events weighing heavily on my mind. Despite the trials, I had started to appreciate my father Shiva more, especially after he saved me. As we walked, I voiced my thoughts to Ashley and Aryan.

"Guys, I think there's more to it than just finding Indra's crown. Yama can't just go and steal it. Someone must have stolen it for him, and I am the last person to realize this, right?"

Both Ashley and Aryan nodded in agreement.

As we walked, the distant sound of a motorcycle engine broke the silence. We decided to hide, our recent encounters making us wary of strangers. The motorcycle stopped near our hiding spot, and a voice called out. When I looked up and saw those fiery eyes, I knew who he wasâ€”Kartikeya, the god of war, and my brother.

"What do you want?" I asked, stepping out from our hiding place.

Kartikeya chuckled. "Indra has sent all the gods under his command to retrieve his crown. As much as I love a good war, I still have to do this," he said. "If you want to talk, I know a halfway decent diner about a mile from here."

We followed him to the diner, where we found him laughing at his mobile, apparently trying to start a war on Twitter. We sat down, and he laid out his terms. "Retrieve my shield from a waterpark, and I'll help you. I'll also take Aryan as collateral."

Reluctantly, Ashley and I agreed. Kartikeya's shield was located at the end of the "Thrill Ride o' Love" tunnel in the waterpark, which turned out to be an awkward and perilous mission.

Upon entering the waterpark, we realized it was built by Tvastar, the god of craftsmen, and that Kartikeya had been seeing Tvastar's wife, Virocana, in this very park. The irony was not lost on us. The "Thrill Ride o' Love" was a tunnel of love boat ride, which made the situation even more awkward.

As we sat in the boat and rowed towards the shield, I couldn't help but notice Ashley's presence beside me. Her proximity made me blush, a feeling that intensified when we reached the shield and were suddenly swarmed by mechanical spiders. For the first time, I saw Ashley scream. Her fear was so intense that she clung to me, her head pressed against my chest.

Despite my own anxiety, I managed to use my newfound connection with water to propel us out of the tunnel and away from the spiders. We landed safely on the other side, but the encounter left us both shaken and awkward around each other.

Returning to the diner, we handed Kartikeya his shield. True to his word, he gave us a bag filled with clothes, food, and golden drachmas. "This will help you on your journey," he said. "Now, get in the truck."

He led us to a truck bound for Las Vegas. As we climbed in, we discovered that the truck was carrying a lion, a zebra, and a black bear in cages. The animals looked at us with wide, fearful eyes, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for them. The truck roared to life, and we began the next leg of our journey, wondering what new challenges awaited us in the City of Sin.
