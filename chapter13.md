### Chapter 13: Descent into Narak

It took us two days to reach Los Angeles. The summer solstice was just one day away, leaving us with less than 24 hours to find Indra's crown. We hurried through the city, desperate to complete our quest. As we traversed the bustling streets, we came across an extraordinary-looking building with the initials DJ etched onto its facade.

Upon entering its doors, we were confronted with a chilling sight: dead-looking people waiting in line, their faces devoid of life. A sign written in Sanskrit confirmed our worst suspicions. We were standing at the entrance to Narak, the realm of the dead. These were the souls waiting for judgment. 

We pushed through the crowd, bumping into the spirits, and made our way into Narak. A huge wall loomed ahead, guarding the realm. As we approached the entrance, two colossal watchdogs, Shabala and Shyama, guardians of Yama, the ruler of Narak, blocked our path. Their eyes glowed menacingly, and their sheer size made them terrifying.

"I have an idea," Ashley whispered. She reached into her bag and pulled out a rubber ball. As Shabala and Shyama drew closer, growling deeply, she tossed the ball far into the distance. The dogs immediately chased after it, giving us a narrow window to slip through the gates. 

"How did you do that?" I asked, impressed by her quick thinking.

"My father had a dog," Ashley replied, her voice tinged with sadness. I noticed a few tears in her eyes and decided not to press further. It was clearly a sensitive topic for her.

Inside Narak, we encountered various realms within the underworld. The Pitris, where the good souls reside, and the main Narak, a nightmarish place reserved for those who had committed grievous sins. We continued our journey towards Yama's palace, a foreboding structure that loomed ominously in the distance.

As we walked, we encountered a deep pit. Suddenly, the winged sandals Aryan was wearing, a gift from Sujan, began pulling us towards it. I barely managed to save Aryan as the sandals flew off his feet and disappeared into the abyss. At the same time, the bag Kartikeya had given us felt noticeably heavier. We ignored the unsettling feeling and pressed on.

Entering the palace, we were greeted by rows of eerie statues, each one seeming to watch us as we passed. The throne room was vast and shadowy, dominated by Yama himself, seated on his throne. He was the first god I had encountered who truly looked like one. With dark, messy hair, pale skin, and pitch-black eyes that seemed to contain trapped souls, his presence was overwhelming. His clothes appeared to be made of the same trapped souls, writhing and twisting within the fabric.

My gaze shifted to the side of Yama's throne, and I froze. There stood my mother, frozen in place, her expression one of terror. 

Yama's voice boomed through the hall, "Are you here to return what is mine in exchange for your mother?"

I was stunned. "What?" I managed to stammer.

Yama's eyes bored into mine. "My mace, which was stolen from me. And have you checked your backpack? You brought Indra's crown right into my palace."

I quickly checked my backpack, my heart racing. To my shock, there it wasâ€”Indra's crown. "How?" I muttered, realization dawning on me. Kartikeya had deceived us. He had stolen the crown all along.

Fury surged through me as I turned back to Yama. "We will find your mace and then you will return my mother to me!"

With that, we rushed out of the palace, our minds set on finding Yama's mace. But escaping Narak was not easy. We had to fight our way through the relentless hordes of the dead, each step a battle for survival. Eventually, battered and exhausted, we emerged from the Santa Monica entrance, the sunlight blinding us after the darkness of Narak.

The journey had taken its toll, but we were more determined than ever. With new resolve, we prepared to face whatever lay ahead, knowing the stakes had never been higher.
