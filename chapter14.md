### Chapter 14: Confronting Kartikeya

Emerging from the Santa Monica entrance of Naraka, we found ourselves on a serene beach. The contrast between the peaceful waves lapping at the shore and the chaos we had just escaped was stark. We stood there, catching our breath, discussing our next move, when suddenly, Kartikeya appeared before us. His face was twisted with anger, his sword poised menacingly behind his neck.

My rage flared. "I've had enough of your games, Kartikeya!" I challenged him to a fight, drawing my pen-sword. His lips curled into a grim smile as he accepted.

The battle that ensued was intense. Kartikeya's skill with a sword was unmatched, and I struggled to keep up. We clashed and parried, our swords ringing out with each strike. My muscles screamed in protest, but I couldn't give up. Not now.

Then, an idea struck me. I called upon my connection to the sea, summoning a massive wave that surged towards Kartikeya. The wave crashed into him, momentarily disorienting the god of war. Seizing the opportunity, I slid between his legs and slashed at his ankle. Golden ichor, the blood of the gods, spilled from the wound.

Kartikeya roared in pain and fury. "You will regret this, demigod!" he bellowed, his voice echoing over the beach. "I curse your sword. When you need it most, it will fail you!"

Before I could respond, Kartikeya began to transform. Aryan's voice cut through the air. "Don't look at his true form! You'll die!"

We averted our eyes, feeling the heat and power radiating from Kartikeya as he shifted. When the light and noise subsided, we cautiously turned back. He was gone, but in his place lay Yama's mace. One of the Furies swooped down, snatching the mace before we could react. I watched, stunned, as she flew off towards Naraka, undoubtedly returning it to Yama.

Ashley and Aryan stared at me, wide-eyed. "You just defeated the god of war," Ashley whispered, her voice filled with awe. "In his own field of expertise."

I shrugged, though my heart was pounding. "We need to get to New York. Fast."

We found a nearby airport and took the next flight to New York, rushing through the bustling city to the Empire State Building. At the entrance, I discreetly showed the guard Indra's helmet. He handed us a security key with a knowing nod.

We took the elevator, scanning the key. A button marked "600" appeared, and we pressed it, feeling the elevator shudder as it ascended to Swarg. As the doors opened, I was struck by the grandeur of the celestial realm. The air was filled with a divine glow, and the palace ahead shimmered with ethereal beauty.

Walking into the throne room, we found Indra seated on his magnificent throne. His presence was overwhelming, radiating power and authority. I stepped forward, holding out his crown.

"Lord Indra, we have retrieved your crown," I said, my voice steady.

Indra's eyes glimmered with approval as he took the crown. "You have done well, Swarn, son of Shiva. Your bravery and determination are commendable."

With our task complete, we left Swarg and returned to the mortal world, taking a taxi to the farmland near Camp Half-Blood. As we entered the camp, we were greeted with cheers and applause. The other campers celebrated our success, though I noticed the children of Kartikeya watching me with sullen expressions. They weren't thrilled about their fatherâ€™s defeat.

Despite their resentment, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. We had faced incredible challenges and emerged victorious. But I knew this was only the beginning. Many more trials lay ahead, and I needed to be ready for whatever came next.
